# Certificator
Repository For Generating Certificates

## How to use
Only one script currently: `createAuthorityAndCertificate.sh`

Haven't tested it but made it after manually doing the steps in the README.md of the createAuthorityAndCertificate folder.

It should generate a certificate authority and a certificate. You have to provide at least one DNS and one IP address. Common Name doesn't count.
